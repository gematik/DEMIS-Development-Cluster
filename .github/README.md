# DEMIS Kubernetes Environment
Project to configure a local or remote cluster with the following resources/services:

- Service Mesh (Istio) with Add-ons (Jaeger, Kiali, Grafana, Prometheus)
- Security Components (trivy)
- Virtual Services definition
- Application Deployment

## Requirements
### System Requirements
A Linux-based system using one of these options:

* Windows Users:
  * Windows Subsystem for Linux ([WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
    * Ubuntu 24.04 LTS distribution preferred
    * Full integration with Windows filesystem
* Linux Users:
  * Any major distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, etc.)
    * Ubuntu 24.04 LTS distribution preferred
* MacOs Users:
  * Not yet available - Images are not yet built for arm64

### Required Tools
Ensure all necessary tools are installed on your system. This include:

- git
- make
- vim
- curl
- unzip
- gpg
- wget
- jq
- yq
- kubectl
- helm
- tofu (OpenTofu)

Hint:
An installation script is already present in the Project "DEMIS-Development-Cluster", in the folder ".scripts" 
and it's called "install-tools.sh".  You can install the required tools when you checkout the Project for the first time.
Run the script in a WSL2/Linux Shell.
```
chmod +x .scripts/install-tools.sh
.scripts/install-tools.sh
```

Additionally, you need to install Docker, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 
or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on WSL2.

## Preparing DNS Entries 
Before making changes, you need to identify your current IP address:
* Windows: Use the command "ipconfig /all" in Command Prompt
* Linux: Use the command "ip a" in Terminal

Use your actual network IP address of the Docker Adapter/WSL or the IP address of your active network adapter.

Typically locations:
* Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
* Linux: /etc/hosts

Add the following lines to the end of the hosts file, with your own IP Address as "<Interface-Ip>":
```
<Interface-Ip> auth.ingress.local
<Interface-Ip> ingress.local
<Interface-Ip> portal.ingress.local
<Interface-Ip> meldung.ingress.local
<Interface-Ip> ti-idp.ingress.local
<Interface-Ip> bundid-idp.ingress.local
<Interface-Ip> storage.ingress.local
```

## Configure Cluster

To configure the environment, you need to prepare the environment as follows:

### Clone this repository
Add your SSH key to your GitHub account and clone the repository using SSH.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:gematik/DEMIS-Development-Cluster.git
```

### Initialize the stage
Once you've checked out the code, go in the folder and run the following command, to initialize the public 
stage environment. For this step you need SSH access to the repository.

```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make local init-stage
```

Now the public stage repository is checked out into the folder `DEMIS-Development-Cluster/environments`.

### Setup the whole environment
To create a new complete Environment, including the KIND Cluster, Service Mesh Services and DEMIS Services, 
you need to run the following command:

```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make create-local-environment
```

### Update only the infrastructure
This command is internally called by the previous one ("Create Environment"), thus it is not necessary to run
it separately, but in case you want to check that the Infrastructure (the KIND Cluster, Istio and Monitoring 
Services) are updated and running, you can use the following command:
```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make local init-stage # updates the current stage repository   
make local infrastructure
```

### Update only the Mesh components
This command is internally called by the "Create Environment" one, thus it is not necessary to run it separately, but in
case you want to check that the Mesh components (the Istio Ingress Gateway, Policies and Network Rules) are updated and 
running, you can use the following command:
```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make local init-stage # updates the current stage repository   
make local mesh
```

### Update only the IDM Services
This command is internally called by the "Create Environment" one, thus it is not necessary to run it separately, but in 
case you want to check that the IDM (Identity Management) components (Keycloak, BundID-IDP, Gematik-IDP, Redis, Policies
and Network Rules) are updated and running, you can use the following command:
```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make local init-stage # updates the current stage repository   
make local idm
```

### Update only the DEMIS Services
You can update the Services in a running KIND Kubernetes Cluster, without destroying and recreating it, using the 
following commands:
```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make local init-stage # updates the current stage repository   
make local services
```

### Usage of K8s Tooling
A kubeconfig file, called `kind-config`, will be automatically generated for the local stage under the folder 
`DEMIS-Development-Cluster/infrastructure`. You can use this file with Tools like Lens or `k9s` or `kubectl` itself.

## Cleanup
The Applications and Cluster can be completely removed, including the running KIND Docker Container, using make, with 
the following command:
```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make cleanup-local-environment
```

If you want to remove only the DEMIS applications, including the "demis" Namespace, PersistenceVolumeClaims, 
Secrets and other Resources, you need to run the following command:
```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make local cleanup-services
```

If you want to remove only the IDM applications (not recommended!), including the "idm" Namespace, PersistenceVolumeClaims, 
Secrets and other Resources, you need to run the following command:
```sh
cd DEMIS-Development-Cluster
make local cleanup-idm
```

## Verifiy Cluster Functionality
To verify that you have successfully configured the DEMIS Environment locally, after the completion of the command 
executed during the step CreateEnvironment, perform the following steps:

1. Open your favorite Browser
2. Navigate to the address https://meldung.ingress.local/portal
3. Dismiss the Warning Message due to the self-signed certificate (depending on the Browser: Accept the Risk)
4. Perform the Login in the Notification Portal, by navigating to https://meldung.ingress.local/withtoken
5. Attempt to send a notification through one of the available Frontend Modules (Disease, Laboratory, Bed Occupancy, IGS)
6. If successful, you should receive a confirmation dialog and your browser will download a PDF Receipt automatically
